## Veer

Veer is a very simple redirector written in PHP.

It features:
- receiving requests from external source
- forwarding address resolution based on request source and extra parameters
- then redirecting to that address
- logging events into a database

Although it wasn't made for you, I believe I have made it fairly easy to understand, use and remember how Veer works.
